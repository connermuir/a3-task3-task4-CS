This task code explores red and purple urchins recorded by Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research program divers. The taks achieve the following: 

Task 3:

1) Filter the raw data to compare the sizes of red and purple urchins in Santa Barbara
2) Generte descriptive statistics (sample size, mean, median, and standard deviation) between the two species
3) Compare purple urchin counts by year and by observation site 

Task 4:

1) Filter the raw data to observe only purple urchins observed on Naples Reef in 2010
2) Explore the data with several visualizations (histogram, QQ plot) 
3) Generate descriptive statistics.
